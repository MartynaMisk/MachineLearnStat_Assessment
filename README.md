# MachineLearnStat_Assessment
Project based on Boston House Prices dataset and the Python packages scipy, keras and jupyter notebook.

First I will interpretate the dataset using Stochasticism, Mathematical models, Regression, T-tests, ANOVA. The repository contains all my work for this assessment. Within the repository, I have created a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/MartynaMisk/MachineLearnStat_Assessment/blob/master/Project-HousePricing.ipynb) that uses descriptive statistics and
plots to describe the Boston House Prices dataset. 

To the above jupyter notebook, I have used inferential statistics to analyse whether there is a significant difference in median house prices between houses that are along the Charles river and those that arenâ€™t. I have explained and discuss my findings within the notebook. 

Again using the same notebook, using keras I created a neural network using 13 variables that can predict the median house price.
