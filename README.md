# MachineLearnStat_Assessment
Project based on Boston House Prices dataset and the Python packages scipy, keras and jupyter.

First I will interpretate the dataset using Stochasticism, Mathematical models, Regression, T-tests, ANOVA.

Then I will use KERAS to explain and buidl a neural network for boston house prices dataset.
